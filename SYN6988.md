### Baud select
K2 default all off

hmm there are four switches but only 2 bit for chip

## Frame structure
- 0xFD
- nn nn frame length
- command

## Commands
- 01 Speech synthesis playback commands
- 01.00 GB2312
- 01.01 GBK
- 01.02 BIG5
- 01.03 Unicode small header
- 01.04 Unicode big header
- 02 Stop compositing command
- 03 pause compositing command
- 04 resume synthesis command
- 21 Chip status query command

### Status query command
0xFD 0x00 0x01 0x21 

response
- 0x4E indicates that the chip is still being synthesized.
- During the broadcast, 0x4F is returned to indicate that the chip is in idle state.

## Responses
After receiving the control command frame, the chip will send a 1-byte status feedback to the host computer. The host computer can determine the current status of the chip based on this feedback.
working status. [7.2]
- 0x4A Initialization successful return
- 0x41 Correct command frame response received
- 0x45 Unrecognized command frame received
- 0x4E Chip broadcast status return
- 0x4F Chip idle status return
